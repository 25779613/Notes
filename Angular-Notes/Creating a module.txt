**Create a module without creating a file(if file exists) and has a routing module
ng g m rooms --routing  --flat=true

**move all declarations and imports related to rooms from app module to rooms module

** under imports in app.module register the rooms module

    ,RoomsModule

** in rooms module under imports add all missing imports from the error list


    FormsModule,

** if there are components that are used in multiple other components create its own module
, doesnt need routing as theres no routes accessed by routes

ng g m header --flat 

** if you add a module under imports it cant be under declarations
'
** if you are using a component outside of its module & is reusable, you have to export it
eg
@NgModule({
  declarations: [HeaderComponent],
  imports: [
    CommonModule
  ],
  exports:[HeaderComponent]
})

** if you have feature routing ,in app.module.ts make sure that it is added before AppRoutingModule under imports
