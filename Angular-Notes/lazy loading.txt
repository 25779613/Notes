** split code based on routes
** requirements
-code that is reusable should not be lazyloaded, only seperate functions should be
- code downloaded only by user interaction
- the module choosen should be removed from any other module(from imports)

** the module to be loaded should be under routes in app routing module 
eg { path: 'rooms', loadChildren: () => import('./rooms/rooms.module').then((m) => m.RoomsModule) },

** in the module that is lazy loaded remove the path name from it
eg
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '', component: RoomsComponent
